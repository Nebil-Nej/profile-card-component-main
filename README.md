## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

```css
.container{
  box-shadow: 0.1em 0.8em 0.8em 1em rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  }
  body {
    background-position: 70vw 60vh, 45vw 50vh;
  }
```

### Continued development

Need more work on CSS, box shadowing and background position especially.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://www.example.com) - Helped me with the Box-shadowing.
- [W3School](https://www.example.com) - Helped me with Background position of the image.
